## My process
- Code the HTML and make sure page has solid structure
- Grab fonts/import from Google Fonts
- Copy colors from design spec into stylesheet and make them variables for better readability
- Code css for mobile layout, and colors/typography etc
- Test 
- Add media query and code desktop layout
- Test, double checking for any additional breakpoints
- Fix any breakpoints if needed, test again

### Built with

- CSS custom properties (for color readability)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that responsive layouts are kind of tricky when you have a specification for number of columns - there's an almost breakpoint viewing it in 600-800px wide screensize where the single column stretches beyond what I would prefer, but three columns are too squished, and I didn't want to wrap the cards. I also was reminded that margin 0 auto only works when you give the parent a fixed width.

### Continued development

Keep practicing with grid - autofit, min-max, etc. Keep practicing using rem and em units until it gets more intuitive for me.
